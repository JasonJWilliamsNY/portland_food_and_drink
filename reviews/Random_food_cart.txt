Gyro place
Type: Food Cart
Genre: Mediterranean

The food was similar to the other half-dozen gyro-selling carts on this block.  It happened to be the closest one,
so I ordered a Super Gyro Chicken.  It was pretty good, certainly better than the chicken shawarma I had for lunch
yesterday at another cart.  The sauce soaked through the pita towards the end and thing got a bit messy but that is
par for the course with cart dining.  Standing around with no place to sit was a bit awkward and the resident busker
singing childrens' songs was annoying and frightened passing children for the most part.  Overall, pretty good.
